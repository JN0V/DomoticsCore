# Specification Quality Checklist: ESP8266 Full Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Written in English (constitution compliance)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- **Approach**: Component-by-component validation in 12 phases
- **WebUI is mandatory**: Must work, not optional
- **RAM budgets defined**: Each component has explicit heap budget
- **Validation checklist**: Track progress phase by phase
- Edge cases cover memory, per-component validation, network, and storage concerns

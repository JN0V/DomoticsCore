## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27

### üéâ First Stable Release

This is the first stable release of DomoticsCore with a complete modular architecture.

### ‚ú® Features

#### Core Architecture
- **Modular Component System**: Header-only components with zero overhead for unused features
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic topological sorting for component initialization
- **Component Registry**: Clean lifecycle management (begin/loop/shutdown)
- **Event Bus**: Inter-component communication with sticky events
- **Status Monitoring**: Component health tracking and diagnostics

#### Components Available

- **Core**: Essential framework with component registry and event bus
- **System**: High-level system orchestration with state management
- **WiFi**: Network connectivity with AP fallback mode
- **LED**: Visual status indication with multiple effects (blink, fade, pulse, breathing, rainbow)
- **Storage**: Persistent data management using NVS Preferences
- **RemoteConsole**: Telnet-based debugging console with log streaming
- **WebUI**: Modern web interface with real-time updates via WebSocket
- **NTP**: Network time synchronization
- **MQTT**: Message broker integration with auto-reconnection
- **OTA**: Secure over-the-air firmware updates
- **HomeAssistant**: Auto-discovery integration
- **SystemInfo**: Real-time system metrics and monitoring

#### System Features

- **LED Error Indicators**: Visual feedback for system states
  - BOOTING: Fast blink (200ms)
  - WIFI_CONNECTING: Slow blink (1000ms)
  - WIFI_CONNECTED: Pulse/heartbeat (2000ms)
  - SERVICES_STARTING: Fade (1500ms)
  - READY: Breathing (3000ms)
  - **ERROR: Fast blink (300ms)** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - OTA_UPDATE: Solid on
  - SHUTDOWN: Off

- **Error State Handling**: Components continue running even when initialization fails, allowing LED indicators and console access for debugging

- **Chunked Transfer Encoding**: WebUI schema endpoint supports large responses (>40KB) via chunked HTTP transfer

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Examples Provided**:
  - FullStack: Complete system with all components
  - CoreOnly: Minimal setup
  - Component-specific examples for each module

### üîß Technical

- **ESP32 Platform**: Optimized for ESP32 microcontrollers
- **Build System**: PlatformIO with proper library dependency management
- **C++14**: Modern C++ features with template-based component system
- **Memory Efficient**: Components only consume resources when used

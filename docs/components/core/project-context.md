# DomoticsCore-Core -- Project Context (AI Agent Reference)

> **All development MUST comply with the [DomoticsCore Constitution](../../../.specify/memory/constitution.md).**

This document provides the context an AI coding agent needs to understand, navigate, and safely modify the DomoticsCore-Core component.

## 4. Dependencies

**DomoticsCore-Core has ZERO library dependencies.** It is the foundational layer. It requires only the Arduino-ESP32 or Arduino-ESP8266 toolchain.

---

## 5. Dependents (Components That Depend on Core)

Every DomoticsCore component depends on Core. Based on `library.json` dependency declarations and `#include` usage:

| Component | Declared in library.json | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| DomoticsCore-MQTT | Yes (`>=1.0.0`) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, Logger |
| DomoticsCore-HomeAssistant | Yes (`>=1.4.0`) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, Core injection |
| DomoticsCore-LED | Yes | Uses IComponent, NonBlockingDelay |
| DomoticsCore-NTP | Yes (`>=1.0.0`) | Uses IComponent, EventBus |
| DomoticsCore-System | Yes (`>=1.0.0`) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, ComponentRegistry |
| DomoticsCore-RemoteConsole | Yes (`>=1.13.0`) | Uses IComponent, LoggerCallbacks, EventBus |
| DomoticsCore-Wifi | Implicit (via includes) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, Logger |
| DomoticsCore-Storage | Implicit (via includes) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, Logger |
| DomoticsCore-OTA | Implicit (via includes) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, Logger |
| DomoticsCore-WebUI | Implicit (via includes) | Uses IComponent, ComponentRegistry, IWebUIProvider |
| DomoticsCore-SystemInfo | Implicit (via includes) | Uses IComponent, EventBus, MemoryManager |

**Impact of changes to Core:** Any breaking change to Core's public API affects ALL components. Exercise extreme caution.
